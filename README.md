# Random-Harvard-Sentences
An extremely simple web app intended for microphone testing, voice training, etc. A random [Harvard Sentence](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html) is displayed in the center of the screen, and you can press space or click to cycle to another one. It is completely static so it can be spun up pretty much anywhere, or just run locally.
